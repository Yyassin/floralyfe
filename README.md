> **Floralyfe** is a remote, real-time and distributed plant monitor-irrigation system -- a project that helps you take care and grow your plants in a healthy manner. Floralyfe aims to make the plant-growing hobby simpler and thus more attractive to broadent the plant-parent demographic. The project consists of a web-interface client, backend GraphQL and WebSocket servers and, of course, the Raspberry Pi devices and hardware hosting the system.

## Features
The *floralyfe* system ensures stress-free and healthy plant growth, allowing individuals to spend more time enjoying their plants rather than worrying about their health. To facilitate the care of houseplants, *floralyfe* provides the functionality below.

### Functionality
**Remote Plant Vital Monitoring:** The system allows users to register themselves and up to two plants they'd like to take care of. Live vital measurements - temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light and green growth - are periodically recorded and sent to the client to be displayed visually.

**Vital Notifications:** Users can specify optimal thresholds for specific plant vitals. During periodic measurements, user's are notified if and which vitals are below their set thresholds with both an email and client-based notification. The icon on the SenseHat also changes to convey the critical vital.

**Closed-loop Automatic Irrigation:** The system employs a state-machine-based feedback loop to water a given plant when its moisture is low. The plant is repeatedly watered until **a)** the water's moisture level is above the set threshold or **b)** there is insufficient water in the tank.

**Plant Live Camera Feed:** Images of the system's environment are repeatedly taken and transmitted to the client to create a live video feed. Users are able to rotate the camera yaw from the client. Once a day, images of each plant are taken and saved to create a timelapse feed.

**Plant-specific Notes:** Users are able to track the growth progress and other details of their plants by creating plant-specific note posts. The notes are akin to a diary to track plant progress.

## Requirements
You'll need a few things before you can start caring for your plants. The materials needed to build a single floralyfe single are provided below.

## Development
The floralyfe system consists of three primary nodes: a NextJS-Chakra Client, an Express-GraphQL server, and distributed Raspberry Pi systems. Independent installation instructions are required for each system.

### Installation
#### Hardware
- Assuming that you have acquired all the hardware components described in the hardware requirements above, refer to **section 4: Hardware Design** in the [Detailed Design Document](https://github.com/AbdallaAbdelhadi/SYSC3010W22_L3_G5/blob/main/documentation/Floralyfe_Detailed_Design.pdf) for hardware connection. Connect the hardware components to the Raspberry Pi as described by the provided circuit diagrams. Any changes to the provided GPIO ports need to be reflected in `Sensors.py` module in the `pi/src` directory.

#### Software
- There are several steps to configuring the three system nodes with regards to software. For brevity, these have been omitted from this primary README and included in a dedicated discussion: [installation.md]().

### Setting up the Development Environment
- The pi node implements a unit test workflow, to help develop code that passes these tests, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/AbdallaAbdelhadi/SYSC3010W22_L3_G5/blob/main/pi/Linting.md) to setup linting for VSCode.
- We recommend using the [Remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) extension on VSCode when developping on the Raspberry Pi.

### Running in Development
- Once all hardware and software requirements have been installed, you can start the systems by following these steps.

1. Start the server by navigating to the `server/` directory and running the  scripts below.

First, start the Firestore database emulator.

```bash
	$ npm run emulator
```

And then, start the server itself.

```bash
	$ npm run dev
```

By default, the WebSocket and Express REST server run on port 5000. The GraphQL server runs on port 5001.

2. Then, start the client by navigating to the `client/` directory and running `npm run dev`.
3. Now, tunnel your ports so they may be accessible remotely. You need to do this so the Pi can access your servers, at a minimum. There are several ways to tunnel the ports: two I suggest are [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
	- With ngrok, locate your config yaml file. On Windows, it'll be under `Users/<your-user>/.ngrok2/ngrok`.
	- Authenticate with ngrok and obtain your auth-token, then set the config file to the following:
	
```yaml

authtoken: 25WHb2ZqTR24fNtm2XCelZC9mKy_6iinQfUBftMg9KcfFstGD
tunnels:
  first:
	addr: 5000
	proto: http
  second:
	addr: 5001
	proto: http
  third:
	addr: 3001
	proto: http
```

And now you can tunnel all of the ports using the command `ngrok start --all`.

4. Once you've tunneled the ports, change the endpoints in the config files in both the `client/` and `pi/` directories.
	- Pi: `pi/src/config/config.py`
	- Client: `client/src/lib/config.ts`
5. Finally, start the Raspberry Pi system by running the main script. First navigate to the `pi/` directory and enter the virtual environment by running `source scripts/run.sh`. Then navigate to the `src/` directory and run `python main.py`. You'll be prompted to login, don't yet.
6. First, register yourself as a user using the sign-up option on the client interface. If successful, you should see a green message. Navigate to `localhost:8000` to see the Firestore instance and your user should be there.
7. Try signing in with your user, you should be redirected to a page that prompts you to pair your RPi device.
8. Now login on the RPi device using the same credentials you signed up with. A successful sign-in will pair your device with your user and begin transmitting data. Refresh the client to wrap-up registration.
9. There you go, now you're able to communicate with your device and register any plants. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
