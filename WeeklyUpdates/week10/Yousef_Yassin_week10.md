1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? 20 hours**

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   1. Software Implementation, 15 hours
   2. Writing/documenting, 5 hours
   
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?***
     - This week I finished implementing all my project unit components - namely the web interface - and also added unit tests for all these units.
     - I created mock sensor components to unit test the Vitals subsystem and sensor interface on the raspberry pi.
     - I created mock websocket clients on all major nodes (RPi, Web Interface and Server) to assert correct message processing.
     - I created and implemented our web interface components, APIs and state management system - in addition to creating a mock database
     to demo the site with local storage.
     - I prepared a script to unit-test all these components in addition to writing a unit-test demo description document.
     - I finalized my technical memo on real time communication using websockets.

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** 
     - Great. The project is effectively done from my end - all that remains is integrating the web interface with the other nodes but once that's done, the nodes
     already have most of their functionality. We're slightly ahead of schedule which is nice knowing - I'm looking forward to wrapping up the project.
  
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? 
     - This week I hope to finish our project. This will involve adding the appropriate backend integration on the web interface - most of these changes have
     already been tested with the end to end demo but it's a matter of placing the changes in the right places and making sure they mutate the client state properly.
     - I also need to finalize the Vital Subsystem - I can test everything with the Sense Hat but am blocked for the rest of the hardware. I'm planning to integrate 
     a new scheduling library to handle timeouts on the Pi as well - in addition to organizing the code a bit.
     - The final thing to do is to add functionality to load the database with 40 common plants and watering data (a basic for loop) just to have dummy data to demo
     with and demonstrate functionality.
     
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
     - Yes. Client and Vital System integration depends on the hardware being complete. Zak is effectively done but Abdalla still needs to finalize the irrigation 
     system, namely the functionality of the water pump. I need him to get that done soon (hopefully Tuesday at the latest). I'll be working to get everything else 
     done until then.
