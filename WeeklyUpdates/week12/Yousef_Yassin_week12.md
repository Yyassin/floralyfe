1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? 15 hours**

   1. Software Implementation, 5 hours
   2. Hardware Integration, 3 hours
   3. Team meeting, 1 hour
   4. Creating Final Demo Video, 3 hours
   5. Preparing and performing final live demo, 1 hour

3. ***What did you accomplish this week?***
     - This week, my group and I finalized our project.
     - I wrapped up integration of the gui with the raspberry pi with the addition of notification and vital subscriptions.
     - I added device pairing capability with refresh upon user login on the webinterface.
     - I finalized and setup the hardware system in my living room. I tested and troubleshooted the system several times to make sure that it was working.
     - With the hardware system setup, I met with my group and we filmed a demo of our system working.
     - My team and I planned and created our final project video which involved creating the powerpoint presentation for the video along with the script.
     - We then prepared and delivered a live demo.
     - After both demos, we have been working on cleaning up the codebase - to date, I have fixed several formatting and type errors and have made our unit testing workflow work again. 
     - We've also been working on our README and final project report - I've written the README and included relevant pieces of media such as our demos. A few pieces of the project report remain, namely reflections. It also needs to be shortened.

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** 
     - Extremely good - it actually worked! We've basically finished the project and I'm really happy with how it turned out, a large success in my eyes. The documentation and cleanup that remains is mostly busy-work and it's mostly a matter of doing the work rather than figuring out how to do it.
  
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? 
     - I'm planning to finalize our Final Project Report, namely in writing our reflections and then proof-reading the report as a group to shorten it.
     - I also plan to go over the rest of our codebase and add any missing documentation (comments, headers) and fix any formatting issues.
     - And that should wrap up our project.
     
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
     - Nothing is blocking me - everyone has been doing their jobs and we're close to being done. We need to plan a time to meet and go over the report as a group and everything should be good from there.
